	// Higher value means the AI can lead a target better

	// Higher value means the AI can compensate weapon dispersion better
	// Higher value means the AI can control the recoil better
	// Higher value means the AI needs to now less to open up fire
	// OPINION: Lowering this in combination with aimingShake may make AI dogshit.
